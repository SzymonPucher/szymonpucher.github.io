I specialize in building self-service data platforms that take away the burden of finding the right data, validation, deployment, and observability from data analysts, enabling them to focus on the logic of the transformations.

Years of experience as a **Back-End Developer** and **Data Engineer** developing such systems used by thousands of analysts taught me ways to do it right, and that I really enjoy doing it.
