I am a passionate **Back-End Developer** and **Data Engineer**.  
I believe that writing maintable software quickly comes with the right experience.
That software must be useful, performant, invitive and stable.

I believe the trust and collaboration are essential to do great work.

I love building systems helping analytics. Shipping data analytics platform, where analysts can simply submit SQL file / Databricks Asset Bundle / Python script. Having it validated automatically, submitted for approval of PROD release and then landing in vast observable system, where thousends of pieces of analytics are transparent, lineage, quality metrics, and statuses visible. And at the end, change made in some system somwhere in the company reliably lands in analytics dashboards, giving actionable insight, being trackable to the source and trusted.  
I love building such platforms and have 7 years of experience building them.
